= Section 1 - Log Enrichment and Prompt Generation Workflow

== Objective

In this section, we will build the first workflow called the **AI Insights and Lightspeed prompt generation** workflow. This workflow will be triggered by Event-Driven Ansible (EDA) whenever an issue is detected in the system. Specifically, this demo is set up to respond to an Apache (httpd) service failure.

This workflow will check the status of the Apache service, notify a Mattermost channel with details, ask Red Hat AI to analyze the incident, and finally create a new job template using the AI-generated prompt for Ansible Lightspeed.

image::enrichment_workflow_diagram.png[Enrichment and Prompt Generation Workflow]

By organizing these steps into a workflow, we simulate how multiple tools can collaborate to enrich a ticket or alert and prepare the remediation plan‚Äîall before a human even reviews the problem.

[quote]
‚ö†Ô∏è This workflow will be automatically triggered by EDA once the `‚ùå Break Apache` job template is run. You must create this workflow before simulating the failure.

== Introducing AI with Ansible

Red Hat AI is already deployed in this lab and powered by the **Granite LLM** model. You can interact with this AI using simple `curl` commands or trigger it through Job Templates via Ansible Automation Platform.

Red Hat AI is deployed using two Ansible Content Collections:

* `redhat.ai` (Certified)
* `infra.ai` (Validated)

These are available as part of your AAP subscription, giving your organization a quick and validated path to deploy generative AI models using automation.

=== Try It Yourself: Talk to the AI!

Before diving into the workflow, let‚Äôs see how easy it is to test this out yourself.

1. Open the **Terminal** in the lab.
2. Run the following `curl` command:

[source, shell, role="execute", subs="attributes+"]
----
curl -X POST http://rhelai.example.com:8000/v1/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {ssh_password}" \
  -d '{
    "model": "/root/.cache/instructlab/models/granite-8b-lab-v1",
    "prompt": "What is the capital of USA?",
    "max_tokens": 100,
    "temperature": 0
  }' | jq -r '.choices[0].text'
----

You can also try real-world prompts like:

[source, shell, role="execute", subs="attributes+"]
----
curl -X POST http://rhelai.example.com:8000/v1/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {ssh_password}" \
  -d '{
    "model": "/root/.cache/instructlab/models/granite-8b-lab-v1",
    "prompt": "systemd[1]: httpd.service: Failed with result exit-code. Suggest a fix for Apache.",
    "max_tokens": 150,
    "temperature": 0.6
  }' | jq -r .choices[0].text
----

This returns a JSON response with helpful AI suggestions. This is exactly what‚Äôs being automated in the next step via the **ü§ñ RHEL AI: Analyze Incident** job template.

== Exploring Mattermost Integration

In this lab environment, we‚Äôve included Mattermost, a lightweight, open-source chat client that serves as a central place to view error logs and AI insights as part of your AIOps workflow.

Think of Mattermost as a stand-in for ServiceNow in this demonstration.

[quote]
üí° In a real-world production environment, you can easily replace Mattermost with ServiceNow (or any other ITSM tool). This enables a more advanced automated workflow, where tickets are automatically created and enriched with logs and insights ‚Äî all before a human even picks up the ticket!

=== Accessing Mattermost

	1.	Open mattermost using the above details
	2.	Click on ‚ÄúView in Browser‚Äù to open the console.
	3.	Login using the credentials provided.
  	4.      Click on the team "Automators".

Once logged in, click on the Town Square channel from the left-hand navigation.

image::mattermost_town_square_placeholder.png[Click on Town Square, 60%, link=‚Äúreplace_with_actual_image_later‚Äù]

=== What You‚Äôll See in Town Square

In the Town Square channel, you will eventually see:

	‚Ä¢	üîç Error logs from the Apache HTTPD service (collected by Filebeat and forwarded via Kafka)
	‚Ä¢	üß† AI Insights generated from the logs using RHEL AI

This real-time feed mimics how production environments might use automated ticket enrichment ‚Äî by capturing logs and insights and sending them directly to a ticketing system like ServiceNow.

[quote]
You won‚Äôt see any messages just yet ‚Äî this step is simply to explain where Mattermost fits in and why this channel matters. Logs and insights will start appearing once the first workflow runs.

[quote]
üí° With this integration, you are essentially watching AI and automation work together ‚Äî detecting the issue, diagnosing it, and preparing remediation guidance before anyone intervenes.

[start=28]
28. Go to Templates and you should be able to see a new job template called "üß† Lightspeed Remediation Playbook Generator" generated. This step also creates a blank Workflow Job Template called "Remediation Workflow" that will be used in next challenge.

== Final Checks & Observations

Before you move on to the remediation phase, take a moment to explore the **Mattermost Town Square** channel.

Here‚Äôs what to look for:

- üõë *HTTPD Error Logs*: These logs were automatically collected from the webserver.
- üß† *AI Insights (RCA)*: Red Hat AI parsed the logs and generated a root cause analysis. These insights help you understand exactly **why** the failure occurred.

This is what real-world AIOps looks like! Imagine this in a production setting:

[quote]
üí° A ticket appears in your ITSM tool with:
- Attached logs
- Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
- A prompt ready for Lightspeed to generate the fix

And all of this *before anyone has even opened the ticket*.

We used **Mattermost** in this lab because it's a lightweight, open-source chat platform that‚Äôs easy to run per student. But the same flow would work with **ServiceNow**, **Jira**, or any ITSM of your choice.

[quote]
üí° Think of this as **automated ticket enrichment**. Logs and RCA can be pre-attached to incidents or alerts, helping teams respond faster and more effectively.

link:_images/mattermost_logs_and_rca_placeholder.png[image:mattermost_logs_and_rca_placeholder.png[Mattermost logs and RCA message preview], window=_blank]

üéØ In short: You now have an intelligent incident response pipeline that goes from *failure detection* to *context* to *fix suggestion* ‚Äî powered by Red Hat AI and Ansible Automation Platform.

== Summary

You created a workflow that:

* Uses logs for root cause analysis via Red Hat AI

* Notifies Mattermost

* Prepares a Lightspeed prompt for automated playbook generation

In the next step, we‚Äôll use that prompt to fix Apache automatically!

== Complete

You have completed this module. Move forward to the next one to use the created templates.
