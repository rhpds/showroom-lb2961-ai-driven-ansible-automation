== Summary of Job Templates

Here's a recap of the job templates and rulebooks used in the lab:
(in chronological order):

Glossary:

*RB* = Rulebook (for Event-Driven Ansible)
*JT* = Job Template (for executing Ansible Playbooks)

|===
| Name | Purpose
| `‚ùå Break Apache` | JT simulates a failure in the Apache config
| `Web App` | RB that watches Kafka queue for httpd disruption
| `‚öôÔ∏è Apache Service Status Check` | JT that checks the current state of Apache
| `ü§ñ RHEL AI: Analyze Incident` | JT that uses RHEL AI to understand the error
| `üì£ Notify via Mattermost` | JT sends incident details to a chat system
| `‚öôÔ∏è Build Ansible Lightspeed Job Template` | JT that creates a JT to generate playbooks
| `üß† Lightspeed Remediation Playbook Generator` | JT that uses Lightspeed to generate the fix
| `üßæ Commit Fix to Gitea` | JT pushes the generated playbook to Git
| `Sync Project` | Workflow node that syncs Gitea project with dynamically created playbooks
| `‚öôÔ∏è Build HTTPD Remediation Template` | JT that creates another JT to apply the AI-generated fix
| `‚úÖ Execute HTTPD Remediation` | JT for Final fix (launched manually)
| `‚úÖ Restore Apache` | JT that Restores Apache to a known-good config
|===

Now here is a walkthrough in the same chronological order:

=== `‚ùå Break Apache`
*Purpose:* Introduces a known bad directive in `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` to cause Apache failure

*What happens next:*

- Filebeat detects the service issue
- Kafka forwards the event
- EDA rulebook matches and triggers `AI Insights and Lightspeed prompt generation` workflow

*Ansible Playbook:*

== EDA Reponse

image::eda_response.png[eda response,500]

=== `Web App`

*Purpose:*
Checks for httpd disruption in a Kafka queue

https://github.com/ansible-tmm/aiops-summitlab/blob/main/rulebooks/web_app.yml[Ansible Rulebook,window=_blank]

== AI Insights and Lightspeed prompt generation workflow

Also known as the `Enrichment Workflow` for short!

image::enrichment_workflow_diagram.png[enrichment_workflow]

=== `‚öôÔ∏è Apache Service Status Check`

*Purpose:*
Checks whether Apache is active and logs its status.

*What it does:*

- Runs `systemctl status httpd`
- Collects output and logs it
- Output is consumed by the next steps (Red Hat AI and Mattermost)

*Ansible Playbook:*
https://github.com/ansible-tmm/aiops-summitlab/blob/main/playbooks/systemd_check_status.yml[Github Link,window=_blank]


=== `ü§ñ RHEL AI: Analyze Incident`

*Purpose:*
Uses Red Hat AI inference service to understand the failure message.

*What it does:*

- Sends logs
- Returns a natural-language description of the error
- Suggests what kind of automation could fix it

*Ansible Playbook:*
https://github.com/ansible-tmm/aiops-summitlab/blob/main/playbooks/rhelai_inference_survey.yml[Github Link,window=_blank]

=== `üì£ Notify via Mattermost`

*Purpose:*
Sends a human-readable incident message to a Mattermost channel.

*What it does:*

- Formats the AI response and Apache status
- Pushes it to a channel using Mattermost Webhook
- Simulates integration with a real ITSM tool like ServiceNow

*Ansible Playbook:*
https://github.com/ansible-tmm/aiops-summitlab/blob/main/playbooks/mattermost_first_message.yml[Github Link,window=_blank]

=== `‚öôÔ∏è Build Ansible Lightspeed Job Template`

*Purpose:* Creates a new job template for the second workflow

*What it does:*

- Create a job template with a survey that includes:

  * A user-defined prompt field
  * A pre-filled prompt from Red Hat AI output

*Why this is important:*

This allows Ansible Lightspeed to generate a remediation playbook without writing code manually. The job template created here will be used in the second workflow.

*Ansible Playbook:*
https://github.com/ansible-tmm/aiops-summitlab/blob/main/playbooks/aap_create_job_template.yml[Github Link,window=_blank]

== Remediation Workflow

image::remediation_workflow.png[remedation_workflow]

=== `üß† Lightspeed Remediation Playbook Generator`

*Purpose:*
Runs the job template created in the previous workflow `AI Insights and Lightspeed prompt generation` to generate a playbook from the AI prompt.

*What it does:*

- Uses Lightspeed to turn a prompt into a YAML playbook
- Stores the result locally as `lightspeed-response.yml`

*Ansible Playbook:*
https://github.com/ansible-tmm/aiops-summitlab/blob/main/playbooks/lightspeed_generate.yml[Github Link,window=_blank]

=== `üßæ Commit Fix to Gitea`

*Purpose:*
Pushes the generated playbook to the Gitea Git repository.

*What it does:*

- Authenticates with Gitea
- Commits `lightspeed-response.yml`
- Makes the playbook available for automation use

*Ansible Playbook:*
https://github.com/ansible-tmm/aiops-summitlab/blob/main/playbooks/scm_pr.yml[Github Link,window=_blank]

=== `Sync Project to Lightspeed-Playbooks`

*Purpose:*
Syncs the git project from Gitea to Ansible Automation Platform

[quote]
üí° This is not a Job Template, but a built-in node that will sync Git projects within the workflow visualizer

=== `‚öôÔ∏è Build HTTPD Remediation Template`

*Purpose:*
Creates a new job template that uses the playbook pushed by Ansible Lightspeed to fix the Apache (httpd) service.

*What it does:*

- Creates a new Job Template called `Execute HTTPD Remediation`
- Uses the dynamically generated `lightspeed-response.yml` playbook
- Sets up the credentials, inventory and prompt for limit

*Ansible Playbook:*
https://github.com/ansible-tmm/aiops-summitlab/blob/main/playbooks/httpd_remediation_job_template.yml[Github Link,window=_blank]

== `Execute HTTPD Remediation`

*Purpose*
Fix httpd on the RHEL webserver

*What is does*

- Removes the bad syntax from the httpd configuration file
- Restarts the httpd service

*Ansible Playbook:*
This Job Template is dynamically generated from Ansible Lightspeed and stored in your Gitea instance.  The Ansible Playbook should look similar to this:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: Fix httpd
  become: true
  hosts: all
  tasks:

    - name: Remove line that contains InvalidDirectiveHere
      ansible.builtin.lineinfile:
        path: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
        regexp: ^InvalidDirectiveHere
        state: absent

    - name: Restart httpd
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: httpd
        state: restarted
----

=== `‚úÖ Restore Apache`

[quote]
üí° This Job Template is optional

*Purpose*
If you want to return Apache to a good state (without running AIOps workflows), you can run the `‚úÖ Restore Apache` job template.

*What it does*

- Should be mostly identical to what you see above for the `Execute HTTPD Remediation`


*Ansible Playbook:*
https://github.com/ansible-tmm/aiops-summitlab/blob/main/playbooks/httpd_fix.yml[Github Link,window=_blank]
